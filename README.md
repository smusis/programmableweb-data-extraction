# programmableweb-data-extraction

To extract API data from ProgrammableWeb (https://www.programmableweb.com/), which is world's leading source of news and information about Internet-based application programming interfaces (APIs). In this project, we crawl web pages of ProgrammableWeb as html files and then extract data such as popular APIs, complementary APIs, tweets related to these APIs etc.
